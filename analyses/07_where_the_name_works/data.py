"""Where a surname works, state by state.

Analyses 01 and 05 report one national number and its split by caste. Neither
says *where* the name works, and the range across states is far wider than the
national figure suggests.

Everything comes from the same source as analysis 01 -- outkast's SECC extract,
`state x birth_year x surname -> n_sc, n_st, n_other`, adults only, cells with
at least 100 records -- pooled to one row per (state, surname).

Two things about that extract govern how these numbers may be read, so they are
computed here rather than left to the note:

`covered_share`  what fraction of the state's Census 2011 population the
                 retained surnames account for. It runs from 3% to 19%, so
                 every per-state result describes surnames that cleared a
                 disclosure floor, not a state.

`removed_top25`  the same score with every state cut to its 25 commonest
                 names. The floor keeps common names, and this repo's own
                 finding is that common names are the uninformative ones, so a
                 state retaining few names could look uninformative by
                 construction. This holds that constant.
