"""Whose name tells you nothing, and whether that group is random.

The other analyses report a population average: a name saves about nine
mistakes per hundred, and for most people it changes nothing. This asks who the
"most people" are, because if the uninformative names are not evenly spread then
every name-based caste method has differential error in a knowable direction --
and that is the thing a downstream user of instate, outkast or a BISG-style
method needs to know before using one.

Two cuts, and both use data already in the repo:

by caste  weight each surname by the people of that caste who carry it, so the
          figure is "mistakes made on a Dalit" rather than "mistakes on average";
by sex    weight by female and male bearers, using naampy's first-name gender to
          sex the roll. Women disproportionately carry devi and kumari, which
          carry no caste signal at all.
