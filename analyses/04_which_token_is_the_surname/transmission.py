"""Find the family name by asking which token passed between two relatives.

Indian electoral rolls record, for every elector, the name of their father or
husband. A token appearing in both names is a token that moved between two
family members, which is what a family name is. Everything else in the name --
an honorific, a filler, a patronymic, an initial -- does not move.

The search covers every position. Taking the last token is what hid the fact
that Maharashtra writes the surname first: `patil ashwini` with father
`patil ashok`. A last-token scorer reports `ashwini`, a given name, and every
aggregate built on it is about the wrong word.
