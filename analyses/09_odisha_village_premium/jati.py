"""Normalise Odia jati strings, and record every merge.

This is a placeholder for a layer being built in upnaam. It is deliberately
small and its whole output is published, so that replacing it later is a matter
of swapping one function and re-running, and so that any result here can be
checked against the merges that produced it.

Three things happen, in order, and each is reported separately because they are
different kinds of claim:

`drop_runaway`   The parser occasionally captures a mutation order rather than
                 a caste, when the caste marker is followed by an entire
                 administrative paragraph. These are identifiable by length and
                 amount to 15 households in 56,439.

`merge_variants` Two spellings of one jati, differing by a vowel sign or a
                 space, are one prediction target. `ଖଣ୍ଡାୟତ` and `ଖଣ୍ଡାଏତ`
                 are the clearest case. Nearness of spelling proposes a merge;
                 it never decides one, because `ଚମାର`/`କମାର`,
                 `ଗଣ୍ଡ`/`ଗଣ୍ଡା` and `ଭୂମିଆ`/`ଭୂମିଜ` are each one edit apart
                 and each two different jatis. A candidate is confirmed by a
                 second signal sharing no input with the first: two spellings
                 of one jati are carried by the same surnames. Merging runs
                 only into a strictly commoner form, so the direction of every
                 merge is determined, and every candidate -- accepted or
                 rejected -- is published with both of its scores.

`drop_rare`      A label carried by a handful of households in a single
                 village is a recording artefact, not a jati. Two thirds of the
                 label strings are of that kind, and quoting them as a group
                 count makes the target look an order of magnitude harder than
                 it is next to Bihar's 141 curated jatis. What qualifies a label
                 is reach rather than size: it must appear in more than one
                 village, and then either be substantial or be found across
                 many villages. The floor is applied after merging, so a rare
                 spelling that found its canonical is not then dropped for
                 having been rare. It removes 0.4% of tenants and moves the
                 premium by 0.05 mistakes per 100, which is why it is a claim
                 about what counts as a jati rather than a cleanup, and why the
                 floor is swept and published.

`strip_religion` A jati may carry a religion as a suffix: `ପାଣ` and
                 `ପାଣ ଖ୍ରୀଷ୍ଟିୟାନ` are recorded separately. Treating those as
                 two targets makes religion a predictor, which this repo does
                 not do. Stripping is therefore available but NOT applied by
                 default: analysis 09 scores both ways and reports the pair, so
                 the effect of the choice is visible rather than assumed.
