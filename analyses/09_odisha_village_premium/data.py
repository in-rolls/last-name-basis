"""Does the village premium travel outside Bihar?

Bihar's land records give this repo its strongest single result: across 141
jatis a surname alone leaves 47 mistakes per 100 and a surname plus a village
leaves 17. Nothing established whether that 30-point collapse is a fact about
surnames and villages or a fact about Bihar.

The Odisha Record of Rights carries a jati and a village for every tenant, so it
can answer the same question with the same protocol. Two limits govern how far
the answer travels, and both are printed beside every number rather than left to
a footnote:

**This is one district, not a state.** The scrape has reached district 24,
Gajapati, and no further. Gajapati is small, heavily Adivasi and on the Andhra
border; its castes are not Odisha's. Nothing here may be labelled "Odisha".

**Each village is a sample.** The fetch caps khatiyans per village, and the cap
has changed between runs, so villages accumulate rather than being censused. The
realised distribution is measured from the data rather than assumed from a
command line, because a constant written here goes stale the moment the scrape
is restarted with a different flag. Village cells are small either way, so
leave-one-out is not optional.

The surname is the **last** token, which is measured rather than assumed. A
token appearing in both a tenant's name and their father's or husband's is an
inherited one, and in Gajapati that token is last 80% of the time, first 11%.
Maharashtra fails the same test in the other direction (analysis 04), so the
test is run per state and never carried over.
