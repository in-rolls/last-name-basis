"""Surname frequencies from instate's 2017 electoral rolls.

Two floors in the shipped table bound everything built on it, and both are
stated in the note rather than left for a reader to discover:

``total_n >= 3``   names appearing once or twice are absent, so the real tail is
                   longer than any curve here.
``len(name) >= 3`` single- and double-letter tokens are gone. In the south that
                   is most of the population: in the Kerala PSC records, 78.5%
                   of 1.44M people have a last token that is one initial.
