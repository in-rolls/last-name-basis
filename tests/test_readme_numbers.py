"""Every headline number on the front page must match the output it came from.

The failure this guards against has happened four times: an analysis is re-run,
its note is regenerated automatically, and the README -- which is written by
hand -- keeps the old number. Nobody notices, because nothing compares the two.

Each claim below pairs a regex against README.md with the output that should
supply the captured number. A claim that no longer matches is either a stale
number or a rewritten sentence; both need a human to look.
