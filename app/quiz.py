"""The quiz's logic, kept out of the Streamlit file so it can be tested.

The game draws one Dalit and one non-Dalit at random and asks which is which.
That is not an illustration of the repo's headline statistic; it is the same
experiment. The ranking measure in `last_name_basis.scoring.ranks_above` is
defined as the share of exactly these pairs in which the Dalit's surname ranks
higher, so a player's score and the data's score are the same quantity.

People are drawn in proportion to how many of them there are, so the pairs a
player sees are the pairs the statistic averages over: mostly common surnames,
occasionally a decisive one.
